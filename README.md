# LOTUS
_LOTUS_ (non-LTE Optimization Tool Utilized for the derivation of atmospheric
Stellar parameters) is a python package for the derivation of stellar parameters via _Equivalent Width (EW)_ method with the assumption of
**1D Non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium**. It mainly applies on the spectroscopic
data from high resolution spectral survey. It can provide extremely accurate
measurement of stellar parameters compared with non-spectroscipic analysis from
benchmark stars.
